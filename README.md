# Shor's Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm used to factorize integers efficiently. The code utilizes the Qiskit library for quantum computing and includes a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter to display measurement outcomes.

## Overview

Shor's algorithm is a groundbreaking quantum algorithm that can factor large integers into their prime factors in polynomial time, which has significant implications for cryptography. This implementation focuses on factoring the number 15 as an example.

## Prerequisites

Before running this code, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- Qiskit (a quantum computing library)
- Tkinter (for the GUI)
- Other dependencies as required by Qiskit and Tkinter
